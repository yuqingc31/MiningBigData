Purpose:

To practice the basic flow of machine learning and to apply regression techniques to solve a practical problem.

Task description: 

The task is to predict future energy use in a household by building regression models.

You need to write Python to predict the energy use and analyse the impact of different factors based on your model. 

Course Learning Outcomes
CLO3: Choose and apply suitable algorithms for particular data mining problems.
CLO4: Design and develop processes and products to solve business problems related to data mining.
CLO5: Communicate effectively in a variety of forms using appropriate terminology.

Instructions
Please read and follow the instructions below to complete the task.

1. Download the dataset Download datasetand code template Download code templateprovided.

2. Read the paper Download paperbelow before you start working on the task - you  may find the information useful.
Candanedo, LM, Feldheim, V & Deramaix, D 2017, 'Data driven prediction models of energy use of appliances in a low-energy house', Energy and buildings, vol. 140, pp. 81-97.Download Candanedo, LM, Feldheim, V & Deramaix, D 2017, 'Data driven prediction models of energy use of appliances in a low-energy house', Energy and buildings, vol. 140, pp. 81-97.

3. Construct a code in Python Jupyter notebook.

4. Analyse and visualise the data.

Identify data dependencies that might be useful for this task and visualise those dependencies using suitable techniques and charts.
Use this analysis to select suitable processing and prediction models for data preprocessing and experimentation and justify your selection.
Include the charts and diagrams together with the code in Jupyter Notebook.
Make sure your charts are of good quality and useful, there is no point to make a chart or a table, if it is not referred to in your discussion. 
5. Pre-process data: use applicable processing techniques such as scaling, conversion and imputation of missing values.

Data preprocessing should be consistent with your analysis, for example, if you use missing values imputation, this should also be shown in the analysis.
6. Implementation:

Implement and train at least two prediction model(s).
You can use the paper and the paper code in your assignment. If you use the code from the paper Download paper, clearly identify which part of the code is used and where, and how it has been adapted to your task. You can also use common Python libraries. Do not use any other code except the code from the lecture, workshop and the above mentioned paper.
Use suitable training/testing methodology, such as data training/test split or cross-validation and justify your decision.
Use suitable model performance metrics and justify your selection.
Test the models using machine learning methodology, and include results for all candidate models .
7. Compare the results from all candidate models, choose the best model, justify your choice and discuss the results.

Show the results of all models in the form of suitable charts and tables.
Select the best performing model, show the final results for this model and justify you selection.
8. Reflect on:

How would you improve the results if time allows.
What you have learned by completing this assignment if anything. (note: you can be honest, if you new all these techniques before, just say that).
Note: If you use any AI assistant model for your assignment, clearly indicate which part of the code/text was used, what kind of model (e.g. GPT-3.5), and quote exact prompt that you used. This is to verify your authorship of the assignment. 

Submission requirements:

You are required to submit all the runnable code(s), analysis and results in one file ( .ipynb), do not zip it, just submit that file.

Do not include the dataset in the submission. Your code must run using common Python libraries. Provide instruction on how to run the code, if needed. 

Submitted file name must be in the form “<your id>_<your_name>_assign1a.ipynb (use the template)”.
